    <h2>Walks</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Going on walks is one of my top favourite things to do because its a time
      where I am super relaxed and at peace.

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Music is probably my most favourite thing ever. It helps me be more
      relaxed, it helps to focus, and there is music for literally every mood
      that exists.

    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Sports have been a lifetime favourite for me, as they are good for my
      health, they are a very fun way to hangout with people, and you can get
      competetive.
